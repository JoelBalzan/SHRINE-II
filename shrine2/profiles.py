  1. coherently dedisperse the X and Y voltages by the trial DM (relative to the DM they were
     already dedispersed to);
  2. form a dynamic spectrum of nchan = 336 coarse channels, one FFT per 336 voltage samples

  7. average down to dt microseconds (sum of dt samples / sqrt(dt)).
They are written out explicitly, and vectorised. SHRINE always left out the last channel and
zapped nothing else; --zap 335 gives SHRINE's profiles exactly.

    because complex voltages sampled at a rate bw cannot tell a frequency f from f + bw.) A shift
