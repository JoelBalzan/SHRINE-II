"""S/N maximisation, as SHRINE's maximise_sn.py: a standalone alternative to structure maximisation.

Use it for very low S/N bursts, where structure maximisation does not work well: there the fit
window or the parabola can fail, and the expansion behind sigma_DM breaks down (the summary's
sqrt(<||e||^2>)/S well above 0.3). The S/N needs only the burst's total fluence in a boxcar, not its
fine structure.

For each trial DM, the smoothed profile S x (Eq. smooth) less a common baseline is searched for the
boxcar, of any start and of length 1 sample to 10 ms, with the largest
S/N = (sum over the boxcar) / (sigma sqrt(length)). The S/N-maximising DM is the trial DM with the
largest boxcar S/N, and its range is where the S/N stays within 1 of that maximum (SHRINE's
criterion; unlike sigma_DM, it has not been calibrated against simulations).

SHRINE's choices are kept:
    sigma    = standard deviation of the residual I - S I over all trial DMs and samples;
    baseline = the smallest value of S I over all trial DMs.
Fixed relative to SHRINE: the S/N of a boxcar of L samples is now its sum of L samples over
sigma sqrt(L) (SHRINE summed L + 1 samples and reported a length of L - 1), boxcars may end at the
last sample, and the range stops at the ends of the trial DMs instead of running past them.
